# Unity Cinematic Camera

![Demo](demo.gif)

This project aims to provide an intuitive and flexible cinematic camera system for Unity, designed for easy authoring and previewing of dynamic camera shots and transitions. It will enable users to create and control cinematic sequences with smooth transitions, keyframing, and scene navigation.

Currently, this project is a WebGL-based demo focusing on camera navigation and scene exploration. It provides basic camera controls for panning, rotating, and adjusting camera angles, while laying the groundwork for future features like camera animation, keyframe-based transitions, and exportable shot sequences.

## Features
- Click-and-drag camera panning (editor-style viewport movement)
- Mousewheel zoom along camera's forward plane
- Hoverable, draggable preview camera with live screen-space render
- UI controls for adjusting camera position and Euler rotation
- Responsive WebGL deployment for easy embedding

## Tech Stack
- Unity 6 LTS
- WebGL Build Target

## Coming Soon
- Keyframe-based camera animation system
- Smooth and spline-based shot transitions
- Shot preview playback and editing
- Scene layout switching and camera presets
- Export/import camera shots as JSON

## Demo
ðŸš§ Embedded WebGL build coming soon
